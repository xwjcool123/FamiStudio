This post is simply going to showcase a few of the most interesting new features and how to use them. Please visit the [change log for a full list of changes, fixes and system requirement changes](../changelog.md#version-430).

## Support for Custom Tunings

You can now create projects at a non-concert pitch. Simply head over to the project settings and set the desired desired frequency!

## Namco 163 Wave Auto-Position 

N163 instruments can now automatically assign the position of the waves to avoid overlap. This also comes with improvements to the register viewer to help troubleshoot issues such as wave overlap.

This first iteration of the feature is a *static* assignment meaning it will automatically scan all notes of all songs and try to assign a position to each instrument that does not created overlap, exactly like a human would do in preview versions.

Maybe in the future we will consider *dynamic* assignment, where waves can be assigned different positions at different moments in the song.

For more information, please check out the [N163 documentation](../expansion.md#expansion/#namco-163).

## Improved copy-pasting

In previous versions, when copy/pasting between songs and projects, everything was matched by name, meaning that if you had an "Instrument 1" in your project and the pasted data also had an "Instrument 1", there were assumed to be the same. 

Starting in 4.3.0, FamiStudio is carefully compare all pasted instrument, samples, arpeggios and patterns to give you the choice on how you want to handle these conflicts. If will offer options such as creating missing instruments, samples and arpeggio as well as renaming items where conflicts are detected.

## New Font & International Characters

The app now uses the **Noto Sans** font. This improves readability on low-resolution monitors and also allows us to render characters of different cultures without having to switch the app language.

## Mobile UI Overhaul

The mobile UI now uses the same widgets as the desktop versions. This mean the look and feel of the app should be more consistent between the two versions, and it will be easier for us to maintain and port to other platforms.

This also allows us to port more features that were desktop-only to mobile:

* Shy mode
* MIDI import
* MIDI export
* Ability to import songs from storage
* Ability to import instruments from storage
* Ability to import DPCM samples from other FMS projects on device storage

## Russian & Korean Translations

The app is now fully available in Russian & Korean! Thanks to Alex, Mkliukang1, Furmilion, Nyaongi and Ospaggi for their hard work!

Also many thanks to all the other translators who are keeping up to date with all the changes.

The app will be coming to iOS. The port has been completed since August but is begin delayed to early 2025 for non-technical reasons.
