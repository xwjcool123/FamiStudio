Android SDK 12
==============

Linux notes 
=========== 
- When slow startup in VM : dbus-launch --exit-with-session mono FamiStudio.exe 
- How to recompile with old linux: 
	- Ubuntu 16.04.6 
	- Install cmake-gui 
	- OpenAL Soft 
		- Install ALSA libs (libasound2-dev) 
		- Download openal-soft code 
		- Run cmake-gui in /build folder. 
		- Configure 
		- Choose static C + C++ libs 
		- Choose Release (no debug info) 
		- Generate. 
		- make! 
	- OGG:
		- Download ogg/vorbis code
		- cmake-gui, static lib, configure
		- CMakeFiles/vorbis.dir/flags.make, add -fPIC
			C_FLAGS = -O3 -DNDEBUG -fPIC 
		- Same for OGG
	- NesSndEmu + NotSoFatso, run script. 
	- RtMidi, need to add static C/C++ libs to cmake file. 
 
MacOS notes
===========
- MacOS Sierra, fully patched is 10.12.6, with AppKit version 1504.83.101
- Must compile vorbis on old version too (like Sierra). 
- If problem installing MacOS VM, see @DOUG fix at

- If NAT network doesnt work (problem is only in Monterey right now) do that:
	ethernet0.virtualDev = "vmxnet3"

Convert PNG to TGA
==================
"c:\Program Files\ImageMagick-7.1.0-Q8\magick.exe" mogrify -path D:\Dump\Icons\Out\Tga -compress RLE -format tga *.png

Android Notes
=============
Key Store
- Alias : FamiStudio
- Pass : Usual x2
- 30 Years
- Only full name entered.
Issues with device monitor not starting:
- Remove new java (11, the one from Microsoft) from the path. Keep the old one (eclipse, 8).

Desktop tutorial GIFs
=====================
- 20 fps
- Add mouse highlights
- Add 1px border
- Not global palette (buggy, creates grayscale images sometimes)

Trailer/scroll 
============== 
- Stashed in 5beed88a1bc487ec2cbc725b9d749a464e57dece. 
 
MkDocs 
======

Backlog: 
=========

========================================
- No-attack refactor:
	- instrument change:
		* optional : disable attack
		* optional : change the instrument, for FM instrument, will look if attack is disabled and not rebind envelopes if disabled.
		* play a note (if attack, reset envelopes)
	- problems:
		* what about the delayed cut thing? 
		* will likely need a couple more zp variables.
- Replace an specific instrument by another in selection (A->B), R+CLICK.
- How to add to the "open with" list on Android.
- Better autosave names?
- Finish phase reset support
- Going in settings unutes all channels.
- Delete instruments resets play head.
- We should be able to drag/copy samples mappings between instruments.
- Export DMC samples on Mobile.
- Option to set snapping auto depending on last resize.
- "Read only" N163 instrument. Just specify RAM position + size. Other instruments will do the writing.
- NSF import issue TF74
- FDS oscilloscope can assert if you use modulation table to produce very low sound.
- Fix "SeparateChannelsExportTndMode"
- Dual APU (VT02) support? Mesen doesnt support it, fuck it. 
- S5B is 1 octave off. Periods are 12 bits, so technically can do lower, but we still bottom at A0???
- Shy mode on mobile?
- BUG : Quit menu does nothing on MacOS
- Weird shift when using an external display with different scaling (ex: 100% vs 150%)
- Add effect to select N163 wave. How does it react in FT.
- Full range volume for expansions?
- Different aspect ratios for video export?
- Improve linux file dialog (Steo feedback)
- Hold SHIFT+click for multiple delete.
- Idea from perkka "When an instrument is selected. Have the channels thats not supported by it slightly faded out, or the channel names that support it in bold or something"
- Do a pass on tooltips for ParamProviders.
- Left resize to preserve release position?
- Display number of selected channels in grid for video export?
- BUG : Drag single pattern (with one note covring the entire pattern) from 1 channel to the other while its playing, the old note keeps playing and adds on top.
- BUG : "theres a bug where when you select a pattern multiple times and you try to change a note, the change is multiplied by the # of patterns you selected", see video.
- Reorder channels for video export.
- Overclocking (2x, 3x, 4x would be a good start).
- Hardware sweep (how to not conflict with smooth vibrato?)
- Scales
- Raw FDS modulation table envelope. 
- Instrument folders + collapse entire sections (samples, arps, etc.) 
- Sound output selection?
- Give better names to auto saves
- Android : Starting scroll on a slider (in vrc7 instrument) changes the value. How to fix???
- Cleanup : remove duplicated fx values (ex: same volume applied multiple times)
- Paste special, option to rename patterns.
- ffmpeg path on Linux should work on path (Puna on CC discord).
- Uncompressed envelopes
- CLI only EXE (Linux only).
- C0 is hidden by scroll bars
- C0 is hidden in piano roll video
- Piano roll scale on desktop?
- Poppin issue on FDS? See messages from "JHÄ€KRI" on discord. Change volume on FDS with a blank waveform.
- Dont reset camera in piano roll when deleting instrument (probably to handle case where you were editing the instrument)
- Improve no-attack.
	- Allow disabling attacks if all envelopes of both instruments are exactly the same.
	- Draw attack as red if user makes a mistake.
